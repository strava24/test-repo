     * Lets say that there are 5000 tickets for an event and the vendor can plan to release those tickets in like 2000 (Early bird tickets),
     * 2000(normal tickets) and now there are 1000 more tickets available for the event
     * This method will return 3000 (No of tickets sold)
     * @param eventId - eventId for which we need the ticket count
     * @return the number tickets sold for an event
